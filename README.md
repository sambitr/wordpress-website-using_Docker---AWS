# wordpress-website-using_Docker(Hosted on AWS)
This repository contains the details as to how to create a simple WordPress website using Docker. The documentaion can be found out on the word file available in the repository.
This wordpress blog page uses below Docker images:
1. WordPress
2. MySql
3. php 

This was originally hosted on AWS free tier EC2 instance and as it was up and running for some time, it was consuming resources. So to save money, I had disabled it from the AWS. But rest assured, this is a working model, with all the feature of a wordpress blog post.
